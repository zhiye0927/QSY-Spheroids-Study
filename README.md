# How to download and run locally

We used [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/), an open-source,
cross-platform package and environment manager that installs software
packages and manages isolated environments to preventing dependency
conflicts between projects. You will need to install this before
proceeding.

Start by downloading a copy of this repository with the Python and R
code files, then…

1.  **Download STL files**
    - Go to the [OSF repository](https://osf.io/ctne9/files/osfstorage)
      and download the folder containing STL models:
      `3d_models_QSY_spheroids_multi_poly`  
2.  **Unzip and place STL files in project directory**
    - Extract the downloaded archive.  
    - After unzipping, copy the entire folder
      **`3d_models_QSY_spheroids_multi_poly`** into the project working
      directory: [:file_folder: `SPHARM_main`](.\py_SPHARM/SPHARM_main)
3.  **Create a new Python environment** Move to the directory in the
    repository that has the Python code, open a terminal window, and
    create a new Python environment for this project to avoid conflicts
    with Python packages you may already have, then we will activate
    this new environment, and install the required packages

<!-- -->

    cd py_SPHARM
    conda create -n spharm python=3.10
    conda activate spharm
    conda install -c conda-forge umap-learn numba llvmlite numpy=1.26.4 scipy=1.12.0  pyvista  open3d pyshtools trimesh  scikit-learn pandas
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4.  **Run the main script-main.py**
    - Run `main.py` in PyCharm.  
    - The script will perform SPHARM calculation on a single 3D model
      and reconstruct it based on the computed results.  
    - You can save figures during the process.  
    - By default, all output results will be saved to the project folder
      [:file_folder: `SPHARM_main`](.\py_SPHARM/SPHARM_main).  
5.  **Run the batch operation script (`batch_operation.py`)**
    - Run `batch_operation.py` in PyCharm.  
    - This script will process all STL files in the folder
      `3d_models_QSY_spheroids_multi_poly` and perform the following
      computations:
      - SPHARM (spherical harmonics) calculation for each model  
      - Rotation-invariant spectrum computation  
      - Spherical harmonic energy (SHE) calculation  
      - UMAP analysis on the rotation-invariant spectrum  
    - You can replace the input folder with your own STL files to
      perform a similar analysis.  
    - By default, all output results will be saved to: [:file_folder:
      raw_data](.\analysis/data/raw_data)  
6.  **Run the curvature script (`curvature.py`)**
    - Locate `curvature.py` in the [:file_folder:
      `SPHARM_module`](.\py_SPHARM/SPHARM_module) and open it in
      PyCharm.  
    - This script will compute the curvature for all STL files in the
      folder `3d_models_QSY_spheroids_multi_poly`.  
    - By default, all output results will be saved to: [:file_folder:
      raw_data](.\analysis/data/raw_data)  
7.  **Run the sphericity script (`sphericity.py`)**
    - Locate `sphericity.py` in the [:file_folder:
      `SPHARM_module`](.\py_SPHARM/SPHARM_module) and open it in
      PyCharm.  
    - This script will compute the sphericity for all STL files in the
      folder `3d_models_QSY_spheroids_multi_poly`.  
    - By default, all output results will be saved to: [:file_folder:
      raw_data](.\analysis/data/raw_data)

This project also provides steps to process and visualize the results in
R.

8.  **Data processing and visualization in R**
    - Open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio.  
    - Run `renv::restore()` to ensure you have all the packages this
      analysis depends on.  
    - Finally, open `analysis/paper/paper.qmd` and render it to produce
      `paper.docx`.

## How to download and run locally in a Docker container

This research compendium includes a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) that
specifies the computational environment used to generate the results
presented in the paper. You can recreate this environment, which
includes R, RStudio and all necessary R packages, on your computer by
following these steps:

1.  Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) on your
    computer
2.  Download the compendium, e.g. from GitHub by clicking on the green
    `< > Code` button above, then click `Download ZIP`, then unzip on
    your computer
3.  Set your terminal working directory to the compendium, and run
    `docker build -t qsy .` (be sure to include the period) to build the
    container on your computer, it will take a few minutes and require a
    fast internet connection.
4.  Run in your terminal
    `docker run --rm -it -e ROOT=TRUE -e PASSWORD=rstudio -dp 8787:8787 qsy`
    to start the container on your computer
5.  Go to <http://localhost:8787/> with your browser and enter `rstudio`
    in both fields to start RStudio in your browser, running in the
    Docker container with all the required depedencies installed
6.  In RStudio, run `rstudioapi::openProject("/home/rstudio/qsy")` to
    open the compendium’s project. This project uses
    [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) to document and manage
    dependencies, this will be activated when the project is first
    opened in RStudio.
7.  Run
    `rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.qmd", output_dir='/tmp')`
    to render the Quarto document that is the manuscript submitted for
    publication
8.  After the code has executed, view the rendered output document by
    running `browseURL("/tmp/paper.docx")`
9.  When finished, to delete the Docker container from your computer,
    run this in the terminal on your desktop:
    `docker ps -aq | xargs docker stop | xargs docker rm`
